Djicoin Node
=================

The goal of Djicoin Node is to create sound money that is usable by everyone
in the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

What is Djicoin?
---------------------

Djicoin is the official digital currency of the nation of Djibouti that enables instant payments to anyone,
anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no
central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out
collectively by the network. Djicoin is an inspiration of Bitcoin & more specifically Bitcoin Cash.
